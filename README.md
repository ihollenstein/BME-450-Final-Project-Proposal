## Project Description
The goal of the project is to use MRI images of the aorta to classify either healthy or diseased aortas.  Once classified as either healthy or diseased, the trained nueral network will determine what disease the patient is experiencing: atherosclerosis, aortic dissection, or an aneurysm.  Atherosclerosis is classified by a build-up of plaque in the artery, leading to narrowing openings of blood vessels.  This can affect blood velocity by increasing blood pressure, as well as create the possibility for embolisms, leading to further risks.  Aortic dissection is a tear in the tunic intima that leads to the "splitting" of the aorta.  Blood will flow in between the layers of the aorta leading to extension of the dissection.  Finally, aneurysms are classified by the ballooning of blood vessel walls which have the possibility to rupture.  All of these conditions have the potential to lead to concerning health risks, therefore diagnoses of these patients is crucial; classification of MRI images through the use of the neural network can lead to streamlined diagnosis processes.
